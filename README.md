## Overview
Participated in a pre-hackathon challenge which we were tasked to recreate a pixel perfect implentation of based on the [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/5WXTnOu1Yy7vjCDCGKSnib/Getlinked?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=PLZShQZrz9cTtyvg-1) and also adding subtle animations to provide user intereaction as we please. As part of the challenge, we were expected to connect to a backend API for categories, contact and register.

## Tech Stack Used
- React
- Styled-components
- GSAP

## Approach
For this project, i opted for a mobile first approach. Using styled-components I set up my global styles and proceeded to set up my routes for the various pages. For each page i broke it down to sections, where in the home page, there was a reusable section component. The animations was the last bit after implementing the design to give it the extra wow factor.
